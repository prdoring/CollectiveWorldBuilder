        <h1>Comprehensive Overview of the City</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This city, nestled between the wild wastes and verdant farmlands, presents a remarkable blend of magic, technology, and diverse cultures. Founded in a post-cataclysmic period, it thrives under the protection of a magical barrier and regulated weather, courtesy of a wellspring of arcane energy discovered by its pioneers. Over the years, this city has evolved into a bustling metropolis, featuring diverse neighborhoods, cutting-edge Arcanotech infrastructure, and a complex societal fabric woven with elements ranging from ancient druidic orders to modern corporate powerhouses.

            <h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hightop:</strong> A well-off area home to corporate types, known for its high security and slower-paced banking procedures due to robust protection measures.</li>
                <li><strong>The Docks:</strong> A rough neighborhood bustling with workers by day and subject to dangerous activities at night; it's also Dag's chosen home.</li>
                <li><strong>Scraptop:</strong> Known for its industrial landscape, this neighborhood, once the city's dump, now hosts metal refineries and is marked by socio-economic divisions evidenced by its proximity to Hightop.</li>
                <li><strong>Woodshed:</strong> A blue-collar, tightly-knit community opposed to high-rise developments, preserving its traditional character.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalboot:</strong> Originally a settlement of tents and kobolds, it has transformed into an artsy and expensive neighborhood, now a hub for TavernStomp performers.</li>
                <li><strong>Slipline:</strong> Located along the city's canal, this neighborhood offers a mix of urban convenience and access to the serene farmlands beyond, protected by the city's magical barrier.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
            <p>The city's societal fabric includes a broad spectrum of beliefs, professions, and cultural practices. The arcano-luddites, with their eschewal of arcanotech in favor of pure magic, contrast sharply with the city's overall reliance on Arcanotech. TavernStomp, emerging from the ordinary revelry of the working class, has vaulted into the cultural limelight, even as socioeconomic disparities are visibly entrenched across different neighborhoods.</p>

            <h2>Infrastructure and Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Arcanotech stands at the core of the city's operations, fueling everything from household utilities to protective barriers against the wastes. The city benefits from a sophisticated network of arcane water plumbing, which is essential not only for day-to-day convenience but also for safeguarding the populace. Companies like Calofive play an integral role in this ecosystem, controlling the production and distribution of refined arcane water, a commodity as vital as it is carefully guarded.

            <h2>Economy and Trade</h2>
            <p>At the heart of the city's economic landscape is the Worbor Bank, facilitating transactions big and small across virtually all neighborhoods. The city teems with independent businesses, many of which have grown from modest beginnings with the bank's financial backing. Trade, particularly in agricultural products from the farmlands, constitutes a lifeline for the city, with The Docks serving as a critical nexus for goods entering the urban sprawl.</p>
