        <h1>City Guide: An In-Depth Overview</h1>

        <div class="section neighborhoods">
            <h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
            <p>The city boasts diverse neighborhoods, ranging from the rough terrains of Scraptop and The Docks, characterized by challenging night-time safety, to the upscale Hightop for corporate powerhouses. Woodshed presents a blue-collar, tightly-knit community resistant to high-rise development. Scalboot has transitioned from a tent city to an artsy, expensive neighborhood, rich with TavernStomp culture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section economy">
            <h2>Economy and Trade</h2>
            <p>The Worbor Bank is the financial backbone, offering comprehensive services and fostering small businesses. Calofive dominates arcane research and development, deeply interwoven with the city's administration and day-to-day operations. TavernStomp performers in Scalboot represent a unique economic entity fueled by the wealthier classes' fascination with the art form.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section infrastructure">
            <h2>Infrastructure and Technology</h2>
            <p>Arcanotech is integral, enabling regulated weather for agriculture and maintaining the city's magical barrier. The city's reliance on refined arcane water, distributed via a network owned by the city and produced by Calofive, reflects the core of technological advancement and its challenges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section society-culture">
            <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
            <p>From the Arcano-luddites' traditionalist beliefs opposing arcanotech to the widespread acceptance of magic in daily life, societal views are varied. TavernStomp has transcended its blue-collar roots to become a controversial art form. Attitudes toward the less fortunate differ markedly by neighborhood, reflecting a complex social fabric.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section people">
            <h2>People</h2>
            <p>A diversity of individuals, including Dag, a homeless halfling around The Docks; Dolo, the city historian; and Sprangle, a paladin of Calofive, animate the city's narrative. They navigate through a life shaped by their professions, societal roles, and the overarching influence of corporations like Calofive and the Worbor Bank.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section law-order">
            <h2>Law and Order</h2>
            <p>The legal landscape is twofold: formal city law enforcement maintains order, while corporate entities like Calofive deploy paladins for internal security. This dual structure underscores the power dynamic within the city, where corporate interests often intersect with or override communal governance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section religion-magic">
            <h2>Religion and Magic</h2>
            <p>Magic is deeply embedded, from the Arcano-luddites' purist stance to widespread acceptance of arcanotech. Paladins serve not gods, but corporations, redefining traditional notions of faith and allegiance. This paradigm underscores a broader reimagining of power sources within the city.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section outside-influences">
            <h2>Outside Influences</h2>
            <p>The city stands as a fortress against the wastes, with its magical barrier and regulated ecosystem. However, weaknesses in this defence expose outlying areas to risk, reflecting the city's interconnectedness with its surroundings and the constant balancing act between progress and protection.</p>
